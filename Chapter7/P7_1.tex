\textbf{Problem 7.1}: Give an example of a function $F$ for which the hypotheses of the Wiener-Ikehara theorem hold with $\sigma_c(\Fhat) = 1$ and $L = 0$. Verify that $F(x) = o(x)$.

\begin{proof}
We need $F$ real valued monotone nondecreasing and $\Fhat(s)$ extends to a continuous function on closed half plane $\{\sigma \geq 1\}$. The latter condition is the same as saying that the limit $\lim_{s \rightarrow s_0} \Fhat(s)$ exists for all $s_0$ on the line of convergence. We could use
$$F(x) = \int_{1^-}^x \frac{dx}{\log^2 ex} \sim \frac{x }{\log^2 ex}$$
in Problem 6.12 (c). We showed there that $\Fhat$ converges at every point on its line of convergence, hence continuous there by Theorem 6.15. Evidently $F(x) = o(x)$.
\end{proof}
